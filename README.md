# About
This website was developed using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as a CMS.

## Credits
- Special credit to [Hiroki Toyokawa](https://github.com/otoyo) to make the [astro-notion-blog](https://github.com/otoyo/astro-notion-blog) open source. Although the repo now diverged significantly, it all started there.

## Concept
I have been using Notion both professionally and on my personal stuff for a while. So, the idea of keeping it all organized on the same platform felt like a no-brainer. Also, this was a great opportunity for me to learn the Astro framework and how to work with APIs.
